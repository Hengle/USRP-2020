# USRP-2020
OSCAR USRP Summer 2020 - "Integrating Procedurally Generated Planets and Ecosystems"

You can find the entirety of the research proposal in the GitHub folder. It outlines my inspiration, process, timeline, and expected outcomes of this project.
### Week 1 - Research and Planning: Procedurally Generated Planets
During this week, I researched the possible resources that would aid in helping me create procedurally generated planets. I'm currently looking at two game engines: Unity and Unreal Engine 4.
The engine which has more resources for this research project will likely be the engine I will use for the remainder of the project.
