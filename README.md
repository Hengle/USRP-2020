# USRP-2020
OSCAR USRP Summer 2020 - "Integrating Procedurally Generated Planets and Ecosystems"

You can find the entirety of the research proposal in the GitHub folder. It outlines my inspiration, process, timeline, and expected outcomes of this project.

### Week 1 - Research and Planning: Procedurally Generated Planets
During this week, I researched the possible resources that would aid in helping me create procedurally generated planets.
I'm currently looking at two game engines: Unity and Unreal Engine 4.
The engine which has more resources for this research project will likely be the engine I will use for the remainder of the project.

#### Resources for Unity
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFt_AvWsXl0cONs3T0By4puYy6GM22ko8) is a youtube playlist by Sebastian Lague. It outlines some of the core elements I would like in a procedurally generated planet such as biomes and oceans.

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFt_AvWsXl0eBW2EiBtl_sxmDtSgZBxB3) is another youtube playlist by Sebastian Lague that walks viewers through procedural land-mass generation.
It could be integrated in this project to have more depth to the landscape.

[Here](https://medium.com/@peter_winslow/creating-procedural-planets-in-unity-part-1-df83ecb12e91) is an article by Peter Winslow which walks an individual through the creation of a low-poly procedural planet.
The article only has a total of three parts; meaning as whole it will be unfinished.

#### Resources for Unreal Engine 4
[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/unrealengine/comments/b2n3c8/procedural_planet/) is a reddit post which shows images of a low-poly planet and it cites the resources that were used (many of them were actually unity resources mentioned above).

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/unrealengine/comments/b2n3c8/procedural_planet/) is the first part of a two part series on creating the basic shape of a planet with a mesh.

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgwhqR8QlpRVKQ5JEWcdjV77lex0q-Oth) is a youtube playlist by Tefel who goes into depth with Unreal to recreate a Minecraft like procedural generation.
